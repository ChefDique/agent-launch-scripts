# Handoff — Neo (`tmux-masta`)

## Last working on

AgentRemote v1.4.6 — form scroll bug investigation.

Richard showed two screenshots of the edit form: one showing bottom rows (AVATAR/PET/ARMORY AGENTS), one showing top rows (ID/NAME). Diagnosed as a scroll-position-persistence bug and shipped v1.4.6 (reset `scrollTop = 0` on form open). Richard then showed the full form rendering correctly and said "you made a horrible assumption." The actual root cause was not confirmed — the scroll reset is benign/good UX but may not have addressed whatever the real underlying issue was.

Also this session: committed registry changes from UI edits (mugatu rename → mugatu-claude, kenpachi runtime → claude, dasha reconfigured to claude/web-designer).

## Open priorities

- [PENDING-RICHARD] Skills (Armory → agent) wiring is broken at five steps: form has no input, IPC save (`main.js` UPDATABLE_FIELDS) doesn't whitelist `skills`, `launch-agent.sh` doesn't extract it, Swarmy's `agentremote_runtime.py` doesn't export it to the spawned process. Touches `~/ai_projects/swarmy` (overlord-swarmy's repo) — needs explicit Richard direction or a coordinated job dispatched through overlord-swarmy.
- [PENDING-RICHARD] Confirm what the actual form rendering issue was (v1.4.6 scroll fix shipped but root cause unconfirmed — "horrible assumption" warning from Richard).
- [PENDING-RICHARD] bypass-perms walkback to Swarmy — prior coord drop `cid neo-claude-to-overlordswarmy-1778357741` (permission-mode default) needs acknowledgement.
- [PENDING-RICHARD] Telegram 401 reissue for Neo channel — needs @BotFather reissue. ALS-008 dispatch_pending bumped high by Xavier 2026-05-04.
- [DEFER] Avatar relocation from git-tracked `remote-app/assets/` to `~/Library/Application Support/AgentRemote/avatars/`. Requires custom protocol or absolute-path convention.

## Cross-session comms

- 2026-05-14 Richard: form showing bottom rows on open, then "now it's the top" — shipped v1.4.6 scroll reset; Richard flagged "horrible assumption" — root cause unconfirmed.
- 2026-05-14 Richard: Codex dropdown missing gpt-5.5; edit form top cut off on open. Both fixed in v1.4.5.
- 2026-05-13 Richard: settings surfaces clipping and stale GPT models; v1.4.4 fixes landed.
- 2026-05-09 Swarmy (`overlord-swarmy-hermes`): two prior coord drops still unacknowledged (`cid neo-claude-to-overlordswarmy-1778356367` auto-send-task, `cid neo-claude-to-overlordswarmy-1778357741` permission-mode default — second one needs walkback).
